# Flappy Bird Clone

# Introduction
Self-explanatory if you ever played Flappy Bird before. If you have not, the objective of Flappy Bird is straightforward: you control a small bird and your goal is to navigate it through a series of pipes without crashing into them. The longer you can keep the bird flying and avoid obstacles, the higher your score becomes.
