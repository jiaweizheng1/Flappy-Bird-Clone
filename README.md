# Flappy Bird Clone

# Introduction
Self-explanatory if you ever played Flappy Bird before. If you have not, the objective of Flappy Bird is straightforward: you control a small bird and your goal is to navigate it through a series of pipes without crashing into them. The longer you can keep the bird flying and avoid obstacles, the higher your score becomes. This was just for fun and to learn more about Javascript :).
